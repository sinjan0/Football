In the 1800s the game was far diffrnt then it is now, back then in some schools you could carry the ball in your hand but in other schools you couldn't. The diffrent rules made it hard for other teams to play against each other. It was in 1863 that finally the first football association was made to normalize the rules of football.</p>
